An implementation of [HQ9+](http://esolangs.org/wiki/HQ9%2B "HQ9+") in Python

Ignores everything except the four valid commands(case insensitive):
    H   Prints "Hello, world!"
    Q   Prints the entire text of the source code file.
    9   Prints the complete canonical lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"
    +   Increments the accumulator.
